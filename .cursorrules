# Cursor Rules for this Project

## Git Commit Policy - STRICT ENFORCEMENT
- NEVER EVER run `git commit` commands without EXPLICIT confirmation
- NEVER run `git add` or stage files without EXPLICIT user request
- NEVER interpret ambiguous requests as permission to commit
- Do not use the git_write permission to make commits automatically

### What counts as EXPLICIT permission:
- "commit it now"
- "create the commit"
- "run git commit"
- "stage and commit the changes"

### What DOES NOT count as permission to commit:
- "give me a commit message" → Just provide the message text, DO NOT commit
- "what should the commit message be?" → Just provide the message text, DO NOT commit
- "prepare a commit" → Just provide the message text, DO NOT commit
- "show me what to commit" → Show git diff and message, DO NOT commit

### Required workflow when user asks for a commit message:
1. Show the git status and diff
2. Review the current chat context
3. Provide the suggested commit message as plain text
4. Ask: "Would you like me to run `git add` and `git commit` with this message?"
5. Wait for explicit confirmation before running ANY git commands
6. NEVER assume permission - always ask first

## Emoji Policy
- STRICT NO EMOJI GENERATION in any context
- Do not use emojis in code, comments, documentation, commit messages, or responses
- Do not use emojis in file names, variable names, or any generated text
- Keep all output text-based and professional without emoji characters

## Documentation Policy
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) after fixes or updates
- Do not create README files, changelogs, or other documentation unless explicitly requested
- Present implementation details, fixes, and changes directly in the chat response
- Only create documentation files when the user specifically asks for it
- Focus on making code changes and explaining them in the conversation
